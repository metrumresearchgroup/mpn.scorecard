\title{list all top-level objects defined in the package code}
\usage{
get_toplevel_assignments(pkg_source_path, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{Logical (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE}, show any warnings/messages per function.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the columns \code{func} and \code{code_file} with a row for
every top-level object defined in the package.
}
\description{
This is primarily for getting all \emph{functions}, but it also returns top-level
declarations, regardless of type. This is intentional, because we also want
to capture any global variables or anything else that could be potentially
exported by the package.
