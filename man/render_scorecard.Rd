\usage{
render_scorecard(
  results_dir,
  risk_breaks = c(0.3, 0.7),
  overwrite = FALSE,
  add_traceability = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results_dir}{directory containing json file and individual results. Output file path from \code{\link[=score_pkg]{score_pkg()}}}

\item{risk_breaks}{A numeric vector of length 2, with both numbers being
between 0 and 1. These are used for the "breaks" when classifying scores
into Risk categories. For example, for the default value of \code{c(0.3, 0.7)},
for a given score: \verb{0 <= score < 0.3} is "Low Risk", \verb{0.3 <= score < 0.7}
is "Medium Risk", and \verb{0.7 <= score < 1} is "High Risk".}

\item{overwrite}{Logical (T/F). If \code{TRUE}, will overwrite an existing file path if it exists}

\item{add_traceability}{Logical (T/F). If \code{TRUE}, append a table that links package functionality to the documentation and test files.
Defaults to "auto", which will include the matrix if found.}
